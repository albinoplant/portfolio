                <p>Hello! My name is Mateusz Ma≈Çecki. I study Information Technology at The West Pomeranian University
                    of Technology in Szczecin. From the moment I started learning web technologies, I'm getting more and more curious.
                    I care about the visual design of the project as much as a solid and planned programming but as I progress the love for clever code writing grows.
