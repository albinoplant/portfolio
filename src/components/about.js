            <p>Hello! My name is Mateusz Ma≈Çecki. I study Information Technology at The West Pomeranian University
                of Technology in Szczecin. From the moment I started learning web technologies, I'm getting more and more curious.
                I care about the visual design of the project but as I progressed, the love for clever code writing grows.
